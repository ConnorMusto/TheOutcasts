3) Interactive Catalogue
   Ideas for it:
   -Catalogue that users interact with that give them real time values related to any item they want to buy, such as which stores to get the specific item from and varying    prices, as well as other informatiion related to that specific product, including rela time stock numbers, for a select store at a certainshopping center/mall.
   pros: 
   -convenient
   - to my knowledge, there isn't an already existing technology like this( nb:it's not like online shopping)
   
   cons:
   - unsure about scalability, will need insight rom mentor.
   - 
   who can be our sponsor:
   - most likely a shopping center/mall interested in our idea,still unsure though

4) Admin System for Hospitals
   Ideas for it:
   -An admin system for hospitals, that can keep track of patients files and medical history, as opposed to using physical files.
   pros:
   - can make the whole process of going to the hospital more efficient and therefore allowing the hospital to see to more patients by reducing time spent of retrieving/organizing their files.
   cons:
   - immplementation would be a constraint, because existing patients would have to have their records added to the system, which could be time consuming.
   -
   who can be our sponsor:
   - well...hospitals?
   - anyone interested in improving the current system hospitals use, really

5) An Edutainment website for deaf kids
  Ideas for it: 
  - A sort of youtube where there are people who use hand gestures to teach and entertain deaf kids.
  - Can also be a for of online interaction for deaf kids (like zoom) where they see each other and share stories.
  - Im not sure about other ideas towards this but then yeah you get my drift 
  
  cons:
  -when coding we cant use words since im unsure if they can read or not. So we will have to include some kind of pictures that explain how the system works.
  
  pros; 
  well deaf people can have their own social and edutainment system.
  
  who can be our sponser:
  Deaf school teachers theyll also provide more details on how deaf kids learn
